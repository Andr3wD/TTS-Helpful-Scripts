Thanks for thinking about contributing! <br/>
There aren't many set rules currently for contributing, just please follow what's below:<br/>

# Rules
Feel free to make a pull request with anything that can be helpful for scripters (both new and old).<br/>
If it doesn't exist already, then please add enough comments to explain how the script works so others can learn.<br/>
Finally, please follow the general code style of the repository (ex: no obfuscated code, must be relatively easy to read). <br/>

# Code Owner
If you make a pull request with a new file that you've made, please edit the CODEOWNERS file with your github name and the new file so that your permission is required for future pushes to the file you own. If you don't care who edits your file, then please say so in your pull request. <br/>
