# TTS-Helpful-Scripts
This is a repository of helpful scripts/tutorials for Table Top Simulator the game.<br/>
It is community driven, so not all scripts here are neccessarily made or edited by one person. <br/>
When possible, credit will be given inside the scripts or in the commit message.<br/>

All scripts are written in TTSLUA, which is different than regular LUA, so you might see some things done differently than they would be done in regular LUA.
