# TTS-Helpful-Scripts
This is a repository of helpful scripts/tutorials for Table Top Simulator the game.
It is community driven, so not all scripts here are neccessarily made or edited by one person. 
When possible, credit will be given inside the scripts or in the commit message.

All scripts are written in TTSLUA, which is different than regular LUA, so you might see some things done differently than they would be done in regular LUA.
